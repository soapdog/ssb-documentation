# Scripts

Instead of forcing everyone into my stack of choice, I'm providing different versions of the scripts used to build the documentation. They should all generate the same files — they'll invoke [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) with the same arguments in the end — but they'll run under different runtimes.

I tend to favour Lua over JS mostly because Lua is simpler and packaged for most systems. On the other hand, most developers on the SSB ecosystem are familiar with JS. 

If you'd rather have a different set of scripts to build the docs, feel free to send a PR.
